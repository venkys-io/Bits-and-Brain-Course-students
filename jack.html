    <h1 style="font-size: 50px;text-align: center;"> Jack-The Ripper</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> <strong>The Jack Ripper</strong> was an unidentified serial killer active in and around the impoverished Whitechapel district of London, England, in 1888.<br>
    In both criminal case files and the contemporaneous journalistic accounts, the killer was also called the <strong>Whitechapel Murderer</strong> and <strong> Leather Apron.</strong><br>
    Attacks ascribed to Jack the Ripper typically involved women working as prostitutes who lived and worked in the slums of the East End of London.<br>
    Their throats were cut prior to abdominal mutilations.<br>
    The removal of internal organs from at least three of the victims led to speculation that their <del>killer</del> had some anatomical or surgical knowledge.<br>
    Here are some pictures of jack and the victims</p>

    <h2 style="color: red;font-size: 30px;"> Murderer</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> The large number of attacks against women in the East End during this time adds uncertainty to how many victims were murdered by the same individual.<br>
         Eleven separate murders, stretching from 3 April 1888 to 13 February 1891, were included in a Metropolitan Police investigation and were known collectively <br>
         in the police docket as the <u>"Whitechapel murders."</u> </p>
